==============================================================================

Week of 8/31 - 9/6 (sample entry)

Project status summary:

    * Total test cases passed: 51
    * New test cases passed this week: alarm-priority, alarm-simultaneous
    * Next test case(s) to attempt: priority-change, priority-sema

We made good progress on the alarm clock scheduler this week, and got it
switched over to priority-based. We are now going to start working on adding
support for changing priorities.

Contribution summary:

    * Larry and Moe met to work on the alarm-priority test case and got that
      working correctly.
    * Curly updated the design document, answering question A4.
    * Curly and Moe completed the alarm-simultaneous test case, based on
      suggestions from Larry.

Questions and issues:

The priority-sema test case looks fairly straightforward, but the expected
output seems unusual. It looks like the priority levels should all be lower
than the main thread, but they seem to preempt the main thread. Why should the
child threads preempt the main thread?

Week of 09/27

Project status summmary: 

	* Total test cases passed:57 

Contribution summary:
	September 25
	All members except for Conner attended and began to set up the 
	project on their local machines

	September 29
	All members met and began working on the project. Pavan and Patrick 
	worked on Argument passing. Mickey and Conner were assigned to work 
	on System Calling. Pavan and Patrick attempted multiple ideas and 
	then created questions to ask during office hours. Mickey and Conner 
	made no progress.

	September 30
	Pavan and Patrick met with Kirkpatrick to have questions answered 
	about the project. Later that day, Pavan, Patrick, and Conner met up 
	to finish Argument Passing. After it was implemented, Pavan proceeded 
	to answer questions in the design document while Patrick taught Conner 
	what was done the in the Argument Passing to get him up to up to speed.

	October 1
	All members except Patrick met up and worked on System Calling. 
	Pavan and Conner worked on a implementation for System Calling 
	however were stuck at an impasse due to an unresolvable compile-time 
	error. Mickey was present when Pavan was working on implementing 
	System Calls however showed no active participation during time 
	spent working.

	October 4
	Pavan and Patrick met to work on System Calling more. Both members 
	tried to implement as much of the logic as they could while still 
	running into the compile time error.

	October 5
	Pavan, Patrick, and Conner met with Kirkpatrick during office hours to 
	ask questions about the implementation of read() and write(). Pavan 
	and Patrick met later that day to reverse using FILE* and started 
	using base C calls. This solved the issue of the compile-time error. 

	October 7
	Pavan and Mickey met with Kirkpatrick during office hours to clarify 
	issues with Pavan continued work on system calls while Mickey and 
	Conner started work on Process Syncronization. Patrick began running 
	the provided hex_dump function to test if argument passing 
	validated correctly.

	October 9
	Pavan continued looking into making the read and write system calls 
	function while Mickey continue working on Process Syncronization. 
	Patrick showed up later and helped Pavan work on System Calling 
	and began to finalize the implementation.  

	October 11
	Conner and Mickey finished process syncronization. Patrick showed up 
	shortly after and worked up on cleaning up the team meeting log. 
	Conner and Mickey finished up the Design Documents required for 
	submission.

	October 12
	Patrick spent a few hours attempts to re-write arg passing from 
	scratch	passed on discussions with other groups and his group 
	members.

	October 17
	Pavan and Patrick met to continue working on argument passing and fix
	the current implementation. Mickey and Conner arrived later to help 
	out as well.	

	October 18
	All members except Patrick showed up and tried to fix arg passing
	using the pre-existing process.c file. They attempted to do the
	passing using a separate page and fix addressing that way.
	
	October 20
	All members showed up and continued to work on argument passing.
	Patrick pushed one of his attempts to the repository and the group
	used that code to fix argument passing and make it work.

	October 21
	All members of the group showed up to continue work on system calls.
	The group began to work on create and remove system calls.

	October 23
	Pavan and Conner went to see Kirkpatrick for more questions regarding
	the file system. Later that day, Pavan implemented the changes that
	were discussed during the office hours.

	<between the dates on Oct 23 and Oct 29>
	Group members worked on sections of the project individually.

	October 29
	Pavan and Conner continued working on the wait system call.

	October 30
	Patrick began working on error checking for test cases. Pavan fixed a bug
	in the wait system call that prevented lists from working.	

	October 31
	Pavan and Patrick discusses current issues with the wait system call. Pavan
	began implementing what was discussed. Mickey was there but was on his phone a lot and
	did not contribute anything meaningful to the project.

	November 1
	Mickey arrived but was a repeat of October 31. Despite asking Mickey to work
	on sections of the project, he did not seem to get anything done or ask for
	help. Patrick fixed a bug in the open system call which prevented anything
	in the file system to have proper pointers. Pavan and Conner continued to
	work on the wait system call. Patrick implemented the rest of the error
	checking to pass test cases.
